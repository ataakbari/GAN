# GAN
Includes various types of Generative Adversarial Networks Using Keras.

1. This is a Conditional GAN model based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784">this paper</a> which generates MNIST-like images based on the requested number. For instance the following results are generated conditioned on values [2, 4, 5, 8] for each row, respectively.
